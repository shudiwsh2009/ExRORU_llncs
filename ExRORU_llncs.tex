\begin{abstract}
A recent paper has proposed new ordering relations with uncertainty between execution of tasks in acyclic process models. This work also gave an algorithm to compute the relations between pair of tasks based on unfolding technology. However, this algorithm has serious limitations. It cannot work for cyclic process models and those with silent transitions and non-free-choice constructs. We show how to overcome these problems by a refinement of the relations (i.e., extended refined ordering relations with uncertainty, ExRORU for short). All these relations can uniquely detect the behavioral differentiation between any pair of process models. Experiments on real-life and synthesized models show that compared to existing algorithms our measure is both effective and scalable.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

In \cite{jin2014computing}, Jin et al. have proposed new ordering relations with uncertainty between execution of tasks in acyclic process models. They refine the causal and concurrency relations between two tasks in a concurrent system with uncertainty according to whether one task is always executed with the other in the same instance. They then propose some rules for adjacent tasks and transitivity rules for non-adjacent tasks, based on which he proposes an algorithm to compute the refined ordering relations for acyclic process models from the unfolding of a WF-net \cite{mcmillan1995technique,esparza1996improvement}. Although the work in \cite{jin2014computing} is elegant, it has some drawbacks.

\end{figure}

On particular, the algorithm in \cite{jin2014computing} cannot work with cyclic Petri nets. Further, in \cite{jin2014computing} silent transitions have not been taken into consideration so that two models with different behavioral sementics may be regarded as the same. For example, the full firing sequences of the model in Figure \ref{fig:sdaExampleA} are $\langle I,A,B,O\rangle$, $\langle I,B,A,O\rangle$, $\langle I,A,O\rangle$ and $\langle I,B,O\rangle$, while the full firing sequences of the model in Figure \ref{fig:sdaExampleB} are $\langle I,A,B,O\rangle$, $\langle I,B,A,O\rangle$, $\langle I,A,O\rangle$, $\langle I,B,O\rangle$ and $\langle I,O\rangle$. But the approach in \cite{jin2014computing} cannot distinguish them from each other.

In a model with non-free-choice constructs \cite{de2003workflow}, sequential relations do not necessarily satisfy transitivity. Take the models in Figure \ref{fig:nfcExampleA} and \ref{fig:nfcExampleB} for example, we can capture the causal relations between $A$ and $C$ as well as $C$ and $E$ from both models. According to \cite{jin2014computing}, it can be infered that $A$ and $E$ satisfy the causal relation. However, this isn't correct in the model with non-free-choice constructs of Figure \ref{fig:nfcExampleA} because only $C$ and $D$ can be executed if $A$ has been executed in the first place.

To solve these three major problems, we extend his ordering relations to more special cases, and introduce the concept of sequential direct adjacency to uniquely differentiate the behavioral semantics of two process models. %Furthermore, since our refined relations have a strong ability to represent the behavioral semantics of a process model, even when they contain special constructs such as silent transitions or non-free-choice, we can utilize them as a proper method to detect the differentiation between two process models.

Differentiation detection can be widely used in many scenarios and it can serve as the basis of a proper similarity measure between process models. There have been various proposals to topics about differentiation detection and similarity measure based on textual information, the topology of process models, or their execution semantics \cite{weidlich2011efficient}. We give a quick introduction to some of them.

Zha et al. \cite{zha2010workflow} represent a model's behavior by transition adjacency relations (TAR for short). But TAR cannot tackle the long-distance dependences between transitions, thus it is not able to handle specific structures like non-free-choice constructs. The BP algorithm \cite{weidlich2011efficient} represents the behavioral semantics of a model based on behavioral profiles between transitions, but it cannot deal with silent transitions and distinguish parallel from loop structures. The PTS algorithm by Wang et al. \cite{wang2010behavioral} and its improvement CFS by Dong et al. \cite{dong2014cfs} utilize refined trace sets of models to compute their similarity and are the most realistic results so far. But extracting the trace sets by both their methods is very time-consuming. Polyvyanyy et al. \cite{polyvyanyy20144c} propose another definition of relations between transitions named 4C spectrum but the hunderds of types of relations in 4C are too complex for comprehension and hard to compute. %It is not a practical method in differentiation detection.

In this paper, we propose a new method called ExRORU to represent the relations between transitions in a process model. ExRORU has two main contributions. First, compared to the method in \cite{jin2014computing}, it extend the process model type for acyclic free-choice WF-nets to any sound WF-nets with silent transitions and non-free-choice constructs. Second, using ExRORU, we can detect behavioral differentiation between any pair of process models uniquely. Here we just say the uniqueness property of ExRORU in an informal way. For space consideration, its formal proof is left for future work.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section gives preliminaries that will be used in this paper. The concept and computation of ExRORU are introduced in Section \ref{sec:relations}. Section \ref{sec:experiments} shows the results of the experimental evaluation, before we conclude the paper and give an outlook on the future work in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}
We will show our algorithm on Petri net. The concept of Petri net has its origin in Carl Adam Petri's dissertation \cite{petri1966kommunikation}.

\begin{definition}[Petri net]\label{def:petrinet}
A Petri net is a triple $(P,T,F)$, where $P$ is a finite set of places, $T$ is a finite set of transitions ($P\cap T=\emptyset$ and $P\cup T=\emptyset$), and $F\subseteq(P\times T)\cup(T\times P)$ is a set of arcs (flow relation).
\end{definition}

We use $M:P\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ to denote a marking of Petri net $N$, where $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers. A Petri net system is a pair $\Sigma=(N,M_{0})$, where $N$ is a Petri net and $M_{0}$ is the initial marking of $N$. For more details about Petri net, please refer to the work of Murata \cite{murata1989petri}. A Petri net which models a workflow is called a WorkFlow net (WF-net) \cite{van1998application}.

\begin{definition}[WF-net]\label{def:wfnet}
A Petri net $PN=(P,T,F)$ is a WF-net (Workflow net) if and only if $PN$ has two special places: $i$ and $o$, place $i$ is a source place: $\bullet i=\emptyset$ and place $o$ is a sink place: $o\bullet =\emptyset$. If we add a transition $t^{*}$ to $PN$ which connects place $o$ with $i$ (i.e. $\bullet t^{*}=\{o\}$ and $t^{*}\bullet=\{i\}$), then the resulting Petri net is strongly connected.
\end{definition}

An intuitive idea to extract the relations between transitions is to generate the reachability graph of a model, which may cause the state explosion problem \cite{mcmillan1995technique}. Javier Esparze proposed the notion of complete prefix unfolding to avoid this \cite{esparza1996improvement}. Therefore, we use his work instead.

\begin{definition}[Ordering Relations]\label{def:orderingRelations}
There are three types of ordering relations between nodes of a net,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] two nodes $x$ and $y$ are in causal relation, denoted by $x<y$, if the net contains a path with at least one arc leading from $x$ to $y$;
		\item[-] $x$ and $y$ are in conflict relation, denoted by $x\#y$, if the net contains two disjoint paths $s\cdot t_{1}...x_{1}$ and $s\cdot t_{2}...x_{2}$ starting at the same place $s$;
		\item[-] $x$ and $y$ are in concurrency relation, denoted by $x~co~y$, if neither $x<y$ nor $y<x$ nor $x\#y$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Occurrence net]\label{def:occurrenceNet}
An occurrence net is a Petri net $O=(B,E,A)$ such that $\forall x,y\in B\cup E:(x,y)
\in A^{+}\Rightarrow(y,x)\notin A^{+}$ and $\forall b\in B:|\bullet b|\leq 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Branching process]\label{def:branchingProcess}
A branching process of a Petri net system $\Sigma=(P,T,F,M_{0})$ is a labelled occurrence net $\beta=(B,E,A,f)$ where the labelling function $f$ satisfies the following properties:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] $f(B)\subseteq P$ and $f(E)\subseteq T$ ($f$ preserves the nature of nodes);
		\item[-] for every $e\in E$, the restriction of $f$ to $\bullet e$ is a bijection between $\bullet e$ (in $\Sigma$) and $\bullet f(e)$ (in $\beta$), and similarly for $e\bullet$ and $f(e)\bullet$ ($f$ preserves the environments of transitions);
		\item[-] the restriction of $f$ to $Min(O)$ is bijection between $Min(O)$ and $M_{0}$ ($\beta$ ``starts'' at $M_{0}$), where $Min(O)$ denotes the set of minimal elements of $B\cup E$ with respect to the causal relation;
		\item[-] for every $e_{1},e_{2}\in E$, if $\bullet e_{1}=\bullet e_{2}$ and $f(e_{1})=f(e_{2})$ then $e_{1}=e_{2}$ ($\beta$ does not duplicate the transitions of $\Sigma$).
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

There are only sequential and parallel structures but neither loop nor exclusive structures in a branching process. A Petri net system may have infinite branching processes, which differ on ``how much it unfolds''. The complete prefix unfolding, or CPU is the minimal one which contains all the markings contained in the branching process.

\begin{definition}[Complete Prefix Unfolding]\label{def:cpu}
Let $O=(B,E,A,f)$ be a occurrence net and $e\in E$ be any event.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] A local configuration $\lceil e\rceil$ of an event $e$ in an occurrence net is the set of events that precede $e$.
		\item[-] The final marking of a local configuration $Mark(\lceil e\rceil)$ is the set of conditions that are marked after all the events in $\lceil e\rceil$ fire.
		\item[-] An adequate order $\prec$ is a strict well-founded partial order on local configurations, so that $\lceil e\rceil\subset\lceil e'\rceil$ implies $\lceil e\rceil\prec\lceil e'\rceil$\footnote{We use the difinition of total order for 1-safe systems defined in \cite{esparza1996improvement}.}.
		\item[-] An event $e$ of a branching process is a cutoff event if there exists a corresponding event $e'$, such that $Mark(\lceil e\rceil)=Mark(\lceil e'\rceil)$ and $\lceil e'\rceil\prec\lceil e\rceil$.
		\item[-] A complete prefix unfolding is the greatest backward closed subnet of an occurrence net containing no events after cutoff events.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Definitions about CPU and related concepts come from the work of Esparza \cite{esparza1996improvement} and Polyvyanyy \cite{polyvyanyy2010structuring}.

\end{figure}

\begin{example}\label{ex:petriAndCpu}
Figure \ref{fig:examplePetriAndCpu} shows a sound WF-net and its CPU. In the unfolding, events labelled as $B$ and $E$ are cutoff events.
\end{example}

Our extended relations are inspired by the work in \cite{van2006decserflow}, which utilizes the relations between activities to model a process.
\begin{definition}[Relation Formulas]\label{def:relationFormulas}
Let $A$ and $B$ be two activities of a process, $A$ and $B$ are in the following relation formulas\footnote{The relation formulas \cite{van2006decserflow} are not complete here, since we only need part of them.}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] Response: when $A$ executes, $B$ has to be executed after it.
		\item[-] Precedence: $B$ could not have been executed until $A$ was executed.
		\item[-] Alternate Response: after the execution of $A$, $B$ has to be executed and between each two $A$ at least one $B$ has to be executed.
		\item[-] Alternate Precedence: before the execution of $B$, $A$ has to be executed first and between each two $B$ at least one $A$ has to be executed.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{ex:relationFormulas}
In the model of Figure \ref{fig:examplePetri}, $D,E$ in the execution sequence $\langle I,D,E,$\\$A,D,C,E,D,O\rangle$ satisfy the formula \textit{alternate response} and \textit{alternate precedence} while transitions $D,O$ do not satisfy the formula \textit{alternate response} and transitions $I,D$ do not satisfy the formula \textit{alternate precedence}.
\end{example}

\section{Extended Refined Ordering Relations with Uncertainty}\label{sec:relations}
In this section, we introduce the concept of ExRORU and its calculation from a WF-net. Let $\Sigma=(P,T,F,M_{0})$ be a sound WF-net, and $U=(B,E,A,f)$ be $\Sigma$'s CPU. Let $x,y\in E$ be two events of the unfolding $U$.

\subsection{Extended Refined Causal Relations with Uncertainty}\label{subsec:causalAndInverseCausal}
CPU uses the technique of cutoff events to avoid the state explosion problem. We can set a mapping between cutoff conditions (conditions after cutoff events) and the conditions after the corresponding event of a cutoff event. Therefore, the branching process expressed in a CPU never ends on a cutoff condition, but will continue from the mapping of a cutoff condition instead.

We use expressions like $[ab\{c,d\}e]$ to represent the semantics of a branching process. Successive letters denote the sequential structure while letters in a brace mean a parallel structure. Different branches of a parallel structure are separated by a comma and could be nested. For example, in the CPU of Figure \ref{fig:exampleCpu}, $[I\{D,AC\}O]$, $[I\{D,BC\}O]$ and $[I\{DED,AC\}O]$ are some branching processes.

Let $\Theta$ be the set containing all the branching processes of $U$, and $\Theta_{x}$ be the set of the branching processes containing event $x$, i.e, $\Theta_{x}=\{\beta\in\Theta|x\in\beta\}$. Our extended causal relations are defined using the notion of $\Theta_{x}$.

\begin{definition}[Always Causal]\label{def:alwaysCausal}
Events $x$ and $y$ are in always causal relation (denoted as $x\twoheadrightarrow y$) iff: $\forall\beta_{x}\in\Theta_{x}$, $x$ and $y$ are in \textit{alternate response} relation.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Never Causal]\label{def:neverCausal}
Events $x$ and $y$ are in never causal relation (denoted as $x\nrightarrow y$) iff: $\forall\beta_{x}\in\Theta_{x}$, $x$ and $y$ are not in \textit{response} relation.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Sometimes Causal]\label{def:sometimesCausal}
Events $x$ and $y$ are in sometimes causal relation (denoted as $x\rightharpoonup y$) iff: neither $x\twoheadrightarrow y$ nor $x\nrightarrow y$.
\end{definition}

The relations above are collectively called causal relation with uncertainty (denoted as $\rightarrow$). We further refine $\twoheadrightarrow$ and $\rightharpoonup$ based on whether two events can be executed adjacently in a trace. A trace is a finite sequence of events $\sigma\in E^{*}$, leading from the source state to the end state by executing the events in order. Let $\Omega$ be the set containing all the traces of $U$.

\begin{definition}[Direct and Indirect Causal Relations]\label{def:sda}
Events $x$ and $y$ are in direct causal relation iff:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] $x\twoheadrightarrow y$ or $x\rightharpoonup y$;
		\item[-] $\exists\sigma=\langle t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n}\rangle\in\Omega,1\leq i<j\leq n,t_{i}=x,t_{j}=y,s.t.~\forall k\in(i,j),t_{k}$ is a silent event.
	\end{itemize}
	$x\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}y$ or $x\overset{D}{\rightharpoonup}y$ (``D'' for direct) if they are in direct causal relation while $x\overset{I}{\twoheadrightarrow}y$ or $x\overset{I}{\rightharpoonup}y$ (``I'' for indirect) if not.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{ex:causalRelation}
In the model of Figure \ref{fig:exampleCpu}, $A$ and $C$ are in \textit{direct always causal} relation ($A\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}C$) since they are in \textit{alternate response} relation among all the branching processes containing $A$ and they can be executed adjacently. $E$ and $O$ are in \textit{indirect sometimes causal} relation ($E\overset{I}{\rightharpoonup}O$) since there may be another $E$ between the first $E$ and $O$, indicating that $E$ and $O$ are not in \textit{alternate response} relation, and there must be at least one $D$ between them. $A$ and $B$ are in \textit{never causal} relation ($A\nrightarrow B$).
\end{example}

With the help of \textit{alternate precedence} and \textit{precedence} relations, \textbf{Always Inverse Causal} ($\twoheadleftarrow$), \textbf{Sometimes Inverse Causal} ($\leftharpoonup$) and \textbf{Never Inverse Causal} ($\nleftarrow$) can be defined in a similar way. The relations above are collectively called inverse causal relation with uncertainty (denoted as $\leftarrow$). Also, we further refine $\twoheadleftarrow$ and $\leftharpoonup$ into four relations, i.e., $\overset{D}{\twoheadleftarrow}$, $\overset{I}{\twoheadleftarrow}$, $\overset{D}{\leftharpoonup}$ and $\overset{I}{\leftharpoonup}$.

% \begin{definition}[Always Inverse Causal]\label{def:alwaysInverseCausal}
% Events $y$ and $x$ are in always inverse causal relation (denoted as $y\twoheadleftarrow x$) iff: $\forall\beta_{y}\in\Theta_{y}$, $x$ and $y$ are in \textit{alternate precedence} relation, i.e., among all the branching processes containing event $y$, every instance of $y$ has to be preceded by an instance of $x$ and the next instance of event $y$ cannot be executed before the next instance of event $x$ is executed.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition}[Never Inverse Causal]\label{def:neverInverseCausal}
% Events $y$ and $x$ are in never inverse causal relation (denoted as $y\nleftarrow x$) iff: $\forall\beta_{y}\in\Theta_{y}$, $x$ and $y$ are not in \textit{precedence} relation, i.e., among all the branching processes containing event $y$, before the execution of every $y$, there mustn't be an instance of $a$ executed.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition}[Sometimes Inverse Causal]\label{def:sometimesInverseCausal}
% Events $y$ and $x$ are in sometimes inverse causal relation (denoted as $y\leftharpoonup x$) iff: neither $y\twoheadleftarrow x$ nor $y\nleftarrow x$.
% \end{definition}

\begin{example}
In the model of Figure \ref{fig:exampleCpu}, $O$ and $D$ are in \textit{direct always inverse causal} relation ($O\overset{D}{\twoheadleftarrow}D$) since they are in \textit{alternate precedence} relation among all the branching processes containing $O$ and they can be executed adjacently. $O$ and $A$ are in \textit{indirect sometimes inverse causal} relation ($O\overset{I}{\leftharpoonup}A$) since there may be no instance of transition $A$ in some branching processes containing $O$ and there must be a $C$ between them. $A$ and $B$ are in \textit{never inverse causal} relation ($A\nleftarrow B$).
\end{example}

We have identified several cases of causal and inverse causal relations and turned them into abstract formulas as shown in Figure \ref{fig:causalCases}. In these cases, $A$ and $B$ are events of an unfolding. The edge labeled with ``Loop $X$'' means that there is a path starting from some condition after $X$ and ending in some condition before $X$ so that $X$ can be executed more than once. The edge labeled with ``Skip $X$'' means that there is a path starting from some condition before $X$ and ending in some condition after $X$ so that $X$ may not be executed. %In other words, events inside a \textit{loop} structure can be executed more than once while events inside a \textit{skip} structure may not be executed.

\end{figure}

% \textcolor{red}{Compress the following two paragraphs}
We omit the \textit{direct} and \textit{indirect} symbol since we cannot determine them in these abstract formulas. For convenience, we use symbol $*$ to represent any numbers of sequential events excluding $A$ and $B$. In Figure \ref{fig:causalCaseA}, we have branching processes such as $[A*B],[A*A*B],[A*A*A*B]...$ for the upper unfolding and $[A*B],[A*]$ for the lower unfolding, both of which indicate that $A$ and $B$ are in \textit{sometimes causal} relation and \textit{always inverse causal} relation, i.e., $A\rightharpoonup B,B\twoheadleftarrow A$. Similarly in Figure \ref{fig:causalCaseB}, we have $A\twoheadrightarrow B,B\leftharpoonup A$.

In Figure \ref{fig:causalCaseC}, a loop structure in the middle part of a branching process will certainly not affect the extended relations between $A$ and $B$, neither will an exclusive structure, i.e., $A\twoheadrightarrow B,B\twoheadleftarrow A$. However, if there are exclusive structures across both $A$ and $B$, such as the unfolding in Figure \ref{fig:causalCaseD}, which has branching processes such as $[A*B],[A*],[*B],[*]$, then $A\rightharpoonup B$ and $B\leftharpoonup A$.

\subsection{Extended Refined Concurrent Relations with Uncertainty}\label{subsec:concurrent}
We use $\Omega_{x}$ to denote the set of the traces containing event $x$, i.e., $\Omega_{x}=\{\sigma\in\Omega|x\in\sigma\}$. Our extended concurrent relations are defined using the notion of $\Omega_{x}$.

We use $\sigma\uparrow X$ to denote the projection of $\sigma$ onto some event set $X\subseteq E$, i.e., a trace $\sigma'\subseteq\sigma$ which only contains those events in $X$ and remains their order in $\sigma$. Let $P(\sigma,x,y)=\sigma\uparrow\{x,y\}$ be the projection of $\sigma$ onto events $x$ and $y$.

\begin{definition}[Always Concurrent]\label{def:alwaysConcurrent}
$x$ and $y$ are in always concurrent relation (denoted as $x\Updownarrow y$) iff: $\forall\sigma_{x}\in\Omega_{x}$,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] $x$ and $y$ are in concurrency relation, i.e., $x~co~y$;
		\item[-] $|P(\sigma_{x},x,y)|\%2=0\wedge\forall_{0\leq k<|P|/2}((P(\sigma_{x},x,y)_{2k+1}=x\wedge P(\sigma_{x},x,y)_{2k+2}=y)\vee(P(\sigma_{x},x,y)_{2k+1}=y\wedge P(\sigma_{x},x,y)_{2k+2}=x)\vee(P(\sigma_{x},x,y)_{2k+1}=y\wedge P(\sigma_{x},x,y)_{2k+2}=y))$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Never Concurrent]\label{def:neverConcurrent}
$x$ and $y$ are in never concurrent relation (denoted as $x\nparallel y$) iff: $\forall\sigma_{x}\in\Omega_{x}$, $x$ and $y$ are not in concurrency relation.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Sometimes Concurrent]\label{def:sometimesConcurrent}
$x$ and $y$ are in sometimes concurrent relation (denoted as $x\Uparrow y$) iff: neither $x\Updownarrow y$ nor $x\nparallel y$.
\end{definition}

The relations above are collectively called concurrent relations with uncertainty (denoted as $\parallel$). We have also identified several cases of concurrent relations and turn them into abstract formulas, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:concurrentCases}.

In Figure \ref{fig:concurrentCaseA}, we have traces such as $\langle I*A*B*\rangle ,\langle I*B*A*\rangle ,\langle I*A*\rangle $ for the left unfolding and traces such as $\langle I*A*B*\rangle ,\langle I*A*A*B*\rangle ,\langle I*A*A*A*B*\rangle ...$ for the right unfolding, which do not satisfy the second condition in Definition \ref{def:alwaysConcurrent}. Therefore, events $A$ and $B$ are in \textit{sometimes concurrent} relation, i.e., $A\Uparrow B$. As for the unfolding in Figure \ref{fig:concurrentCaseB}, events $A$ and $B$ may be executed both once or not executed at all, indicating that $A\Updownarrow B$. It is easily seen that traces in the unfolding of Figure \ref{fig:concurrentCaseC} satisfy the second rule in Definition \ref{def:alwaysConcurrent}, so $A$ and $B$ are in \textit{always concurrent} relation, i.e., $A\Updownarrow B$. The unfolding in Figure \ref{fig:concurrentCaseD} shows a non-free-choice construct, which we will go into details later.

Table \ref{tab:relations} shows the summary of all proposed relations.

\subsection{Computing ExRORUs from an Unfolding}\label{subsec:computationOfRelations}
%As mentioned before, an intuitive idea to derive our relations is based on reachability graphs. Such technique would face a state explosion problem, especially when the WF-net contains a parallel with large scale of transitions. Theoretically, the reachability graph will derive all the reachable states by combining the executions of transitions within a parallel structure. Another problem is that we actually cannot distinguish the causal relation caused by loop structure and parallel structure using the reachability technique. By definitions, causal relations caused by parallel structure are not considered in our extended refined ordering relations. 
As mentioned before, using reachability graphs to derive our relations would face a state explosion problem. %And we actually cannot distinguish the causal relation caused by loop and parallel structure using the reachability technique, the latter of which is not considered in our definitions. 
So we adopt the ``unfolding technology'' in this paper. It is not possible to derive the relations based on a sound WF-net itself because a WF-net describes the structure of a process rather than its behavior.

Another intuitive idea is to check our relations based on all the branching processes, i.e., $\Theta$ of a CPU. However, $\Theta$ may be an infinite set, which is not practical to compute and utilize. Therefore, motivated by the abstract formulas in Figure \ref{fig:causalCases} and Figure \ref{fig:concurrentCases}, we will derive our relations on a CPU by tracing the directed path from one event to another and check every condition to determine whether there is a \textit{loop} or \textit{skip} structure.

Similarly, we can trace backwards along the path from one event to another to derive the inverse causal relation between them. It should be noticed that $\rightarrow$ and $\leftarrow$ may not have the same uncertainty for one pair of events. For example, we have $A\overset{I}{\twoheadrightarrow}O$ but $O\overset{I}{\leftharpoonup}A$ in the CPU of Figure \ref{fig:exampleCpu}. Furthermore, $D\overset{D}{\rightharpoonup}E$ and $E\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}D$ both exist due to the cycle in the CPU, which cannot be computed in \cite{jin2014computing}.

As for the extended concurrent relations between events $a$ and $b$, there are actually two relations which should be taken into consideration, i.e., $a\parallel b$ and $b\parallel a$. We firstly find the entrance of the parallel structure, and trace the path from there to $a$ and $b$. By checking every condition to find out all the \textit{loop} and \textit{skip} structures, we can derive the extended concurrent relations between them.

We have defined the relations between events in a CPU, which will be utilized to compute the relations between transitions in a WF-net next. On general, there may be more than one corresponding event in the CPU related to a transition in the original WF-net. These corresponding events are different from each other and are treated as unique events when we derive the relations between events in the unfolding. Therefore, when we try to derive the ExRORUs between transitions in the WF-net, we need to check the relations between each pair of corresponding events of those transitions. Based on this, we give the computation of ExRORU between transitions. Let $Corr_{E}(A)$ be the set containing all the corresponding events of transition $A$.

\begin{definition}[Extended Causal Relations Between Transitions]\label{def:causalRelations}
Transitions $A$ and $B$ are in: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] \textbf{always causal relation} (denoted as $A\twoheadrightarrow B$) iff: $\forall a\in Corr_{E}(A), \exists b\in Corr_{E}(B), s.t.~a\twoheadrightarrow b$; Further, $A\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}B$ if $\exists a\in Corr_{E}(A), b\in Corr_{E}(B),$ $s.t.~a\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}b$, $A\overset{I}{\twoheadrightarrow}B$ otherwise;
		\item[-] \textbf{never causal relation} (denoted as $A\nrightarrow B$) iff: $\forall a\in Corr_{E}(A), \forall b\in Corr_{E}(B), a\nrightarrow b$;
		\item[-] \textbf{sometimes causal relation} (denoted as $A\rightharpoonup B$) iff: neither $A\twoheadrightarrow B$ nor $A\nrightarrow B$; Further, $A\overset{D}{\rightharpoonup}B$ if $\exists a\in Corr_{E}(A), b\in Corr_{E}(B), s.t.~a\overset{D}{\rightharpoonup}b$, $A\overset{I}{\rightharpoonup}B$ otherwise.
	\end{itemize}  
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Extended Inverse Causal Relations Between Transitions]\label{def:inverseCausalRelations}
Transitions $B$ and $A$ are in: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] \textbf{always inverse causal relation} (denoted as $B\twoheadleftarrow A$) iff: $\forall b\in Corr_{E}(B), \exists a\in Corr_{E}(A), s.t.~b\twoheadleftarrow a$; Further, $B\overset{D}{\twoheadleftarrow}A$ if $\exists b\in Corr_{E}(B), a\in Corr_{E}(A),s.t.~b\overset{D}{\twoheadleftarrow}a$, $B\overset{I}{\twoheadleftarrow}A$ otherwise;
		\item[-] \textbf{never inverse causal relation} (denoted as $B\nleftarrow A$) iff: $\forall b\in Corr_{E}(B), \forall a\in Corr_{E}(A), b\nleftarrow a$;
		\item[-] \textbf{sometimes inverse causal relation} (denoted as $B\leftharpoonup A$) iff: neither $B\twoheadleftarrow A$ nor $B\nleftarrow A$; Further, $B\overset{D}{\leftharpoonup}A$ if $\exists b\in Corr_{E}(B), a\in Corr_{E}(A), s.t.~b\overset{D}{\leftharpoonup}a$, $B\overset{I}{\leftharpoonup}A$ otherwise.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Extended Concurrent Relations Between Transitions]\label{def:concurrentRelations}
Transitions $A$ and $B$ are in: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[-] \textbf{always concurrent relation} (denoted as $A\Updownarrow B$) iff: $\forall a\in Corr_{E}(A),\exists b\in Corr_{E}(B),s.t.~a\Updownarrow b$;
		\item[-] \textbf{never concurrent relation} (denoted as $A\nparallel B$) iff: $\forall a\in Corr_{E}(A),\forall b\in Corr_{E}(B),a\nparallel b$;
		\item[-] \textbf{sometimes concurrent relation} (denoted as $A\Uparrow B$) iff: neither $A\Updownarrow B$ nor $A\nparallel B$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Using the notions and computations described in the previous sections, we can derive ExRORUs of the model in Figure \ref{fig:examplePetri}. For convenience, we use three separate matrices to represent the three types of relations, as shown in Table \ref{tab:example_relations}. Transitions in rows are the former ones in a relation while transitions in columns are the latter ones in a relation. For example, the second row shows all the relations between $A$ and the other transitions.

% \subsection{Sequential Direct Adjacency between Transitions}\label{subsec:sda}

% As shown in Table \ref{tab:sdaExample}, the ExRORUs of the two models in Figure \ref{fig:sdaExampleA} and \ref{fig:sdaExampleB} are the same, but the behavioral sementics of them are not (refer to Example \ref{ex:drawback2}). By looking into the executing semantics of these models, we find that the introduction of silent transitions influences the adjacency of visible transitions, i.e., $I$ can be directly followed by $O$ in Figure \ref{fig:sdaExampleB}, but not in Figure \ref{fig:sdaExampleA}. Inspired by the idea of TAR \cite{zha2010workflow}, we propose the concept of sequential direct adjacency to take the effects of silent transitions into consideration.

% \begin{definition}[Sequential Direct Adjacency]\label{def:sda}
% Let $\Sigma=(P,T,F,M_{0})$ be a WF-net and $A,B\in T$ are two visible transitions. $A$ and $B$ are in sequential direct adjacency iff:
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item[-] $A$ and $B$ are not in cocurrency relation;
% 		\item[-] $\exists\sigma=\langle t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n}\rangle\in\Omega,1\leq i<j\leq n,t_{i}=A,t_{j}=B,s.t.~\forall k\in(i,j),t_{k}$ is a silent transition.
% 	\end{itemize}
% $A\overset{D}{\rightarrow}B$ (``D" for \textit{direct}) if they are in sequential direct adjacency while $A\overset{I}{\rightarrow}B$ (``I" for \textit{indirect}) if not. Similarly, we can also define SDA on $\leftarrow$ relation, denoted as $B\overset{D}{\leftarrow}A$ and $B\overset{I}{\leftarrow}A$.
% \end{definition}

% We use SDA to distinguish those transition pairs which can be executed adjacently from those which cannot. By applying Definition \ref{def:sda} on the two models in Figure \ref{fig:sdaExampleA} and \ref{fig:sdaExampleB}, we derive further refined ExRORUs as follows:
% \begin{displaymath}
% 	\begin{aligned}
% 		\text{(a)} & A\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}O, B\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}O, I\overset{D}{\rightharpoonup}A, I\overset{D}{\rightharpoonup}B, I\overset{I}{\twoheadrightarrow}O\\
% 		& O\overset{D}{\leftharpoonup}A, O\overset{D}{\leftharpoonup}B, A\overset{D}{\twoheadleftarrow}I, B\overset{D}{\twoheadleftarrow}I, O\overset{I}{\twoheadleftarrow}I\\
% 		\text{(b)} & A\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}O, B\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}O, I\overset{D}{\rightharpoonup}A, I\overset{D}{\rightharpoonup}B, I\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}O\\
% 		& O\overset{D}{\leftharpoonup}A, O\overset{D}{\leftharpoonup}B, A\overset{D}{\twoheadleftarrow}I, B\overset{D}{\twoheadleftarrow}I, O\overset{D}{\twoheadleftarrow}I
% 	\end{aligned}
% \end{displaymath}

% Using further refined ExRORU, we can distinguish the two models with silent transitions.

% \section{Similarity Measure}\label{sec:similarity}
% In this section, we introduce how extened relations and sequential direct adjacency are used to measure the similarity between two process models.

% By combining extended relations and sequential direct adjacency together, we give the computation of the similarity between two WF-nets. For any ordered transition pair $A,B$ in a process model $M$, we can capture three types of extended relations between them, i.e., $R_{\rightarrow}^{M}(A,B)$, $R_{\leftarrow}^{M}(A,B)$ and $R_{\parallel}^{M}(A,B)$. We use a couple $R_{h}^{M}(A,B)=(\gamma,\delta)$ to represent their extended relations, where $h\in\{\rightarrow,\leftarrow,\parallel\}$, $\gamma$ is the uncertainty (``A'' for \textit{always}, ``S'' for \textit{sometimes} and ``N'' for \textit{never}), $\delta$ is the sequential direct adjacency (``D'' for \textit{direct} if $A\rightarrow_{D}B\in SDA-set$ and ``I'' for \textit{indirect} otherwise). For convenience, we use ${R_{h}^{M}}_{pair}$ to denote the transition pair in $R_{h}^{M}$.

% On the other hand, we think two extended relations with the same $\delta$ are more similar than two extended relation with different $\delta$, so we set a weight $\lambda$ to balance the influence of sequential direct adjacency.

% For two extended relations $R_{h}^{P}=(\gamma_{P},\delta_{P})$ and $R_{h}^{Q}=(\gamma_{Q},\delta_{Q})$ with the same $h$ and transition pair from two models $P$ and $Q$ respectively, we have:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:relationOperations}
% 	\begin{aligned}
% 		R_{h}^{P}\cap R_{h}^{Q}&=
% 			\begin{cases}
% 				0 & \gamma_{P}\neq\gamma_{Q}\\
% 				\lambda & \gamma_{P}=\gamma_{Q}\wedge\delta_{P}\neq\delta_{Q}\\
% 				1 & \gamma_{P}=\gamma_{Q}\wedge\delta_{P}=\delta_{Q}
% 			\end{cases}\\
% 		R_{h}^{P}\cup R_{h}^{Q}&=1
% 	\end{aligned}
% \end{equation}

% Relations of the same type are gathered in the same extended relation set. Therefore, we have three extended relation set, namely $RS_{\rightarrow}^{M}$, $RS_{\leftarrow}^{M}$ and $RS_{\parallel}^{M}$.  Now we give the definition of intersection and union operation of these sets.

% \begin{definition}[Intersection and Union Operation of Relation Sets]\label{def:relSetOperations}
% Given two extended relation sets $RS_{h}^{P}$ and $RS_{h}^{Q}$ from two models $P$ and $Q$ with the same $h$. Then we have:
% 		\begin{align}
% 			RS_{h}^{P}\Cap RS_{h}^{Q}= & \sum_{R_{h}^{P}\in RS_{h}^{P},R_{h}^{Q}\in RS_{h}^{Q},{R_{h}^{P}}_{pair}={R_{h}^{Q}}_{pair}}{R_{h}^{P}\cap R_{h}^{Q}}\label{eq:RSintersection}\\
% 			RS_{h}^{P}\Cup RS_{h}^{Q}= & \sum_{R_{h}^{P}\in RS_{h}^{P},R_{h}^{Q}\in RS_{h}^{Q},{R_{h}^{P}}_{pair}={R_{h}^{Q}}_{pair}}{R_{h}^{P}\cup R_{h}^{Q}}\label{eq:RSunion1}\\
% 			& +|\{R_{h}^{P}\in RS_{h}^{P}|\nexists R_{h}^{Q}\in RS_{h}^{Q},s.t.~{R_{h}^{P}}_{pair}={R_{h}^{Q}}_{pair}\}|\label{eq:RSunion2}\\
% 			& +|\{R_{h}^{Q}\in RS_{h}^{Q}|\nexists R_{h}^{P}\in RS_{h}^{P},s.t.~{R_{h}^{P}}_{pair}={R_{h}^{Q}}_{pair}\}|\label{eq:RSunion3}
% 		\end{align}
% \end{definition}

% Finally, we give the similarity measure as follows:

% \begin{definition}[ExRORU Similarity]\label{def:similarity}
% Given two WF-nets $P$ and $Q$, the ExRORU similarity between them is:\\
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:similarity}
% Sim(P,Q)=\sum_{h}\omega_{h}\cdot Sim(RS_{h}^{P},RS_{h}^{Q})
% \end{equation}
% with $h\in\{\rightarrow,\leftarrow,\parallel\}$ and weighting factors $\omega_{h}\in\mathbb{R},0<\omega_{h}<1$ such that $\sum\limits_{h}\omega_{h}=1$. The similarity between relation set is:\\
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:setsimilarity}
% Sim(RS_{h}^{P},RS_{h}^{Q})=\frac{|RS_{h}^{P}\Cap RS_{h}^{Q}|}{|RS_{h}^{P}\Cup RS_{h}^{Q}|}
% \end{equation}
% \end{definition}

% \begin{example}\label{ex:similarity}
% For the two models in Figure \ref{fig:similarityExample}, we can capture their extended relations as shown in Table \ref{tab:similarityExample} and \textit{SDA-sets} as follows:
% \begin{displaymath}
% 	\begin{aligned}
% 		\text{(a)} & A\rightarrow_{D}B, B\rightarrow_{D}C, B\rightarrow_{D}D, D\rightarrow_{D}B\\
% 		& B\leftarrow_{D}A, C\leftarrow_{D}B, D\leftarrow_{D}B, B\leftarrow_{D}D\\
% 		\text{(b)} & A\rightarrow_{D}B, A\rightarrow_{D}E, B\rightarrow_{D}C, E\rightarrow_{D}E\\
% 		& B\leftarrow_{D}A, E\leftarrow_{D}A, C\leftarrow_{D}B, C\leftarrow_{D}E
% 	\end{aligned}
% \end{displaymath}
% According to our definitions above, Formula \ref{eq:RSintersection} and \ref{eq:RSunion1} will be applied on the light gray area, while Formula \ref{eq:RSunion2} on the medium gray area and Formula \ref{eq:RSunion3} on the dark gray area. For example, $Sim(RS_{\rightarrow}^{P},RS_{\rightarrow}^{Q})=\frac{6}{9+7+7}=\frac{6}{23}$. Similarly, we have $Sim(RS_{\leftarrow}^{P},RS_{\leftarrow}^{Q})=\frac{6}{23}$ and $Sim(RS_{\parallel}^{P},RS_{\parallel}^{Q})=\frac{9}{23}$. If we use $\omega_{h}=\frac{1}{3}$ as our weighting factors, we get a similarity value between $P$ and $Q$ as $\frac{6/23+6/23+9/23}{3}\approx 0.304$.

\section{Experimental Evaluation}\label{sec:experiments}
We have implemented an algorithm\footnote{https://github.com/shudiwsh2009/ExRORU} to extract ExRORUs from a process model based on the CPU in jbpt\footnote{https://code.google.com/p/jbpt/}. In this section, we present the experimental evaluation of our algorithm from both effectiveness and efficiency perspectives. We evaluate the effectiveness by comparing it with other algorithms and evaluate the efficiency by applying our algorithm on real-life datasets.

\subsection{Effectiveness Comparison}\label{subsec:effectiveness}
Examples in this section together with the models in Figure \ref{fig:sdaExampleA} and \ref{fig:sdaExampleB} show the powerful capability of ExRORU to represent the behaviors of a process model.

\paragraph{Non-free-choice constructs}\label{par:nfc} 
Figure \ref{fig:nfcExampleA} shows a WF-net with non-free-choice constructs \cite{de2003workflow} and Figure \ref{fig:nfcExampleB} shows a similar WF-net that is free choice.

Take TAR algorithm for example, the TAR-sets of them are both $\{\langle A,C\rangle, \langle C,D\rangle$, $\langle B,C\rangle, \langle C,E\rangle\}$. However, it is obvious that their behaviors are not the same, since the trace set of the model in Figure \ref{fig:nfcExampleA} is $\{\langle A,C,D\rangle,\langle B,C,E\rangle\}$ while the tract set of the model in Figure \ref{fig:nfcExampleB} is $\{\langle A,C,D\rangle,\langle A,C,E\rangle,\langle B,C,D\rangle,\langle B,C,E\rangle\}$.

Actually, there are only two branching processes in the CPU of the model in Figure \ref{fig:nfcExampleA}, i.e., $[A\{C\}D]$ and $[B\{C\}E]$. Therefore, we have $A\overset{I}{\twoheadrightarrow}D$ and $B\overset{I}{\twoheadrightarrow}E$. On the other hand, there are four branching processes in the CPU of the model in Figure \ref{fig:nfcExampleB}, i.e., $[ACD],[ACE],[BCD],[BCE]$, indicating $A\overset{I}{\rightharpoonup}D$ and $B\overset{I}{\rightharpoonup}E$. Thus, ExRORU can detect the differences between these two models.

\paragraph{Multi-relation} is another special structure we want to discuss. An example WF-net with multi-relation and its CPU are shown in Figure \ref{fig:exampleMultiRelation}. Transitions $A$ and $D$ are in multi-relation since they can be both in causal and concurrency relation. From the unfolding in Figure \ref{fig:multiRelExampleCpu}, we know there are two branching processes, i.e., $[I\{AC,BD\}O]$ and $[I\{A\}E\{D\}O]$. Using ExRORU, we have $A\overset{I}{\rightharpoonup}D$ and $A\Uparrow D$ simultaneously.

}
\caption{A WF-net with multi-relation and its CPU\label{fig:exampleMultiRelation}}
\end{figure}

Most algorithms such as BP and TAR cannot recognize the multi-relation in a process model since they categorize transition pair into one type of relation, which may cause unexpected problems.

\paragraph{Silent transitions} can also influence the behavior of a model, as mentioned before. In the model pairs of Figure \ref{fig:sdaExampleA}, \ref{fig:sdaExampleB} and \ref{fig:silentExamples}, BP fails to recognize the differences between all four cases while TAR fails in Figure \ref{fig:silentExampleB} and \ref{fig:silentExampleC}. 

On the other hand, ExRORU easily detects the behavioral differentiation between the model pairs. We have $I\overset{I}{\twoheadrightarrow}O$ in the model of Figure \ref{fig:sdaExampleA} but $I\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}O$ in the model of Figure \ref{fig:sdaExampleB}. In Figure \ref{fig:silentExampleA}, we have $A\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}B$ and $A\overset{I}{\twoheadrightarrow}C$ in the left model but $A\overset{D}{\rightharpoonup}B$ and $A\overset{D}{\twoheadrightarrow}C$ in the right one. And we have $B\Uparrow C$ in the left model but $B\Updownarrow C$ in the right one in both Figure \ref{fig:silentExampleB} and \ref{fig:silentExampleC}.

\subsection{Efficiency Comparison}\label{subsec:efficiency}
Our dataset contains real-life models from several enterprises such as TC, DG and SAP. The basic features of these models are summarized in Table \ref{tab:datasets}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{The structural features of real-life process model datasets\label{tab:datasets}}
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{|c|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline
	\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\multirow{2}{*}{Dataset}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\multirow{2}{*}{Size}} & \multicolumn{3}{|c}{Average} & \multicolumn{3}{|c}{Minimum} & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Maximum}\\ \cline{3-11}
	\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\#transitions} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\#place} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\#arcs} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\#transitions} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\#place} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\#arcs} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\#transitions} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\#place} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\#arcs}\\ \hline
	DG & 94 & 8.56 & 8.89 & 17.78 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 34 & 33 & 70 \\ \hline
	TC & 89 & 11.47 & 10.28 & 22.93 & 6 & 5 & 11 & 28 & 29 & 58 \\ \hline
	SAP & 389 & 4.47 & 7.51 & 11.51 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 21 & 31 & 56 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As for comparison, TAR and BP algorithms are based on the relations between tasks as we do while PTS and CFS are based on the abstract trace sets which seems closer to reality. Therefore, we conduct experiments using ExRORU together with the four above and compare their efficiency. The average time costs on extracting behavioral features of each process model are shown in Table \ref{tab:efficiency}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Efficiency comparison of five algorithms\label{tab:efficiency}}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|p{1.5cm}<{\centering}|p{1.5cm}<{\centering}|p{1.5cm}<{\centering}|p{1.5cm}<{\centering}|p{1.5cm}<{\centering}|} \hline
		\diagbox{Dataset}{Cost(ms)}{Algo} & TAR & BP & PTS & CFS & ExRORU\\ \hline
		DG & 0.41 & 2.15 & 0.52 & 0.42 & 10.89\\ \hline
		TC & 0.59 & 2.01 & 0.39 & 0.40 & 15.34\\ \hline
		SAP & 0.09 & 0.37 & 0.06 & 0.07 & 1.43\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As we can see from the result, ExRORU is the slowest algorithm due to some reasons. Firstly, models in these datasets are mostly acyclic and lack parallel constructs so that the state explosion problem may not happen in algorithms utilizing reachability graph or coverability tree such as PTS, CFS and TAR. Secondly, most of the time consumption in simialrity measure such as CFS is spent in the similarity computation between the behavioral features of models. While comparison between two models using ExRORU is extremely fast. Finally, considering that ExRORU contains much more details about relations between tasks than other algorithms, the time cost of it is acceptable. To our best knowledge, ExRORU is the only existing algorithm that can handle many special structures such as silent transitions, non-free-choice constructs and multi-relation, which shows its outstanding effectiveness.

\subsection{Scalability Comparison}\label{subsec:scalability}
We have artificially constructed two sets of process models to test the scalability of five algorithms. The first set contains 11 models with increasing numbers ($5,10,...,55$) of concurrent branches with only one transition on each of them, which we call breadth-scalability dataset. The other one contains 11 models with exactly five concurrent branches but increasing numbers ($1,2,3,...,11$) of sequential transitions on each of them, which we call depth-scalability dataset. The time costs on extracting behavioral features of both datasets are shown in Figure \ref{fig:scalability}. Note that we can only capture the time costs of TAR, PTS and CFS on the first two or three models of both datasets because the state explosion problem occurs. The time costs of TAR, PTS and CFS increase extremely fast due to state explosion problem while ExRORU has an acceptable efficiency performance compared to BP.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
To better describe the relations between the execution of tasks in a process model, we extend a previous work on refined ordering relations with uncertainty. In our paper, we define three types of extended relations, all of which can be refined into three sub types. We give the computation of our extended relations based on unfolding. In order to uniquely measure the differentiation between process models, we introduce the notion of sequential direct adjacency. Our algorithm is the only existing algorithm that can handle many complex structures and has an acceptable time performance, as shown in the experiments conducted with three real-life model datasets.

Our algorithm is still not fast enough, compared to other mainstream algorithms which also utilize the relations between tasks, but it can always differentiate between any pair of models. Faster implementation should be explored in future work. Furthermore, all the good properties that ExRORU has will be investigated thoroughly as well as their formal proof. Finally, we will apply ExRORU on more real datasets having process models with various sizes.
